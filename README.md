# Booking-UI

As a part of Guided Research course [IN2169], a prototype of map-based recommender system has been developed. The main emphasis is on the use of various characteristics and features for displaying accommodation on the map. Prototype consists of static website and has been implemented with vanilla JavaScript. Google Maps API has been used for displaying items on the map.
